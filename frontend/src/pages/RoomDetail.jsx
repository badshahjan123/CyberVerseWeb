A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) allows systems to exchange data over HTTP using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. It follows a client-server architecture, where the client sends requests and the server responds with structured data, usually in JSON format. REST APIs are lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate, making them the standard choice for web and mobile apps. Key principles include: Stateless (each request contains all needed information), Uniform Interface (standard methods), Resource-Based (everything treated as a resource), and Cacheable (responses can be cached for performance).",

Backend responsibilities include authenticating users and managing sessions, handling requests and processing logic, maintaining data integrity and security, and ensuring performance and scalability.
