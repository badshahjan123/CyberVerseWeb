## üîç Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Email Not Sending?

**Check 1: Email Credentials**
```powershell
# Open .env file and verify:
EMAIL_USER=yourname@gmail.com  # Your actual Gmail
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop  # App password (no spaces!)
```

**Check 2: 2FA Enabled**
- Gmail requires 2-Factor Authentication to generate app passwords
- Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
- Enable "2-Step Verification"

**Check 3: Backend Console**
- Look at the backend terminal
- Check for error messages
- Common error: "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"
  - Solution: Generate new app password

**Check 4: Test Email Service**
- The backend will log email sending attempts
- Look for "Email sent successfully" or error messages

### ‚ùå Email Goes to Spam?

**This is normal for development!**
- Always check your spam/junk folder
- Mark emails as "Not Spam" to train your email provider
- For production, use SendGrid or Mailgun

### ‚ùå Verification Link Not Working?

**Check 1: Link Expired?**
- Verification links expire in 24 hours
- Use "Resend Verification Email" button

**Check 2: FRONTEND_URL**
- Open `backend/.env`
- For local testing, should be: `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173`
- For production: `FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com`

### ‚ùå OTP Not Working?

**Check 1: OTP Expired?**
- OTP codes expire in 10 minutes
- Click "Resend OTP" to get a new code

**Check 2: Correct OTP?**
- Make sure you're entering the latest OTP
- Check the timestamp in the email

**Check 3: Device Changed?**
- Using VPN? Different IP = new device
- Different browser? Different User-Agent = new device
- This is expected behavior for security
