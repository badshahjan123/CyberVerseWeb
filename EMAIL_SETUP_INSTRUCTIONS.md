## üîß What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Configure Email Service (REQUIRED)

You need to add your email credentials to the `.env` file. The easiest way for testing is using Gmail.

#### Option A: Gmail (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer"
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

3. **Update `.env` file** (located at `backend/.env`)
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop  # Remove spaces from app password
   ```

#### Option B: Other Email Providers

**SendGrid:**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

**Mailgun:**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-mailgun-username
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-mailgun-password
```

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## üß™ Testing the System

### Test 1: Email Verification on Signup

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```powershell
   Set-Location "c:\Users\BADSHAH JAN\Desktop\CyberVerseWeb\backend"
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```powershell
   Set-Location "c:\Users\BADSHAH JAN\Desktop\CyberVerseWeb\frontend"
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Register a new user:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/register
   - Fill in the form and submit
   - You should be redirected to `/email-verification-pending`

4. **Check your email:**
   - Open the verification email (check spam folder if needed)
   - Click the "Verify Email Address" button
   - You should be redirected to the dashboard and automatically logged in

5. **Expected Email:**
   - Subject: "Verify Your CyberVerse Account"
   - Blue gradient design with CyberVerse branding
   - Verification button that expires in 24 hours

### Test 2: OTP on New Device Login

1. **Login with verified account:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/login
   - Enter your credentials
   - Since this is a "new device", you'll be redirected to `/verify-otp`

2. **Check your email:**
   - Open the OTP email
   - Copy the 6-digit code

3. **Enter OTP:**
   - Paste or type the OTP on the verification page
   - Click "Verify OTP"
   - You should be logged in and redirected to dashboard

4. **Expected Email:**
   - Subject: "CyberVerse Login Verification Code"
   - Red gradient design (security alert theme)
   - 6-digit OTP code
   - Device information (browser, OS, device name)
   - Expires in 10 minutes

### Test 3: Trusted Device Login

1. **Logout and login again:**
   - Logout from the dashboard
   - Login with the same credentials
   - You should be logged in immediately (no OTP required)
   - This is because your device is now "trusted"

## üéØ How It Works

### Registration Flow:
```
User Registers ‚Üí Email Sent ‚Üí User Clicks Link ‚Üí Email Verified ‚Üí Auto Login ‚Üí Dashboard
```

### First Login (New Device):
```
User Logs In ‚Üí New Device Detected ‚Üí OTP Sent ‚Üí User Enters OTP ‚Üí Device Trusted ‚Üí Dashboard
```

### Subsequent Logins (Trusted Device):
```
User Logs In ‚Üí Device Recognized ‚Üí Immediate Login ‚Üí Dashboard
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

1. **Check console logs:**
   - Look for errors in the backend terminal
   - Common issues: wrong credentials, 2FA not enabled

2. **Gmail specific:**
   - Make sure 2FA is enabled
   - Use app password, not regular password
   - Remove spaces from app password
   - Check "Less secure app access" is OFF (use app password instead)

3. **Test email service:**
   - Check if EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD are set correctly
   - Try sending a test email manually

### Email Goes to Spam?

- This is normal for development
- Check spam/junk folder
- For production, use SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES
- Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records

### OTP Not Working?

1. **Check expiration:**
   - OTP expires in 10 minutes
   - Request a new OTP if expired

2. **Check device fingerprint:**
   - Device ID is based on User-Agent + IP
   - Using VPN or changing browsers creates a "new device"

### Verification Link Not Working?

1. **Check expiration:**
   - Verification links expire in 24 hours
   - Use "Resend Verification Email" button

2. **Check URL:**
   - Make sure FRONTEND_URL in .env matches your frontend URL
   - For local development: `http://localhost:5173`
   - For production: `https://your-domain.com`

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Before Deploying:

1. **Update FRONTEND_URL in `.env`:**
   ```env
   FRONTEND_URL=https://prismatic-kangaroo-95c131.netlify.app
   ```

2. **Use Production Email Service:**
   - Don't use Gmail for production (rate limits)
   - Recommended: SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES

3. **Configure DNS Records:**
   - Add SPF record
   - Add DKIM record
   - Add DMARC record
   - This improves email deliverability

4. **Test Email Delivery:**
   - Test with multiple email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
   - Check spam scores
   - Monitor bounce rates
