APIs are the backbone of modern web development, connecting frontend applications to databases and enabling communication between different services.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nIn this room, you'll discover how web applications communicate behind the scenes. We'll start with the basics of HTTP and REST architecture, then dive into building your first API using Node.js and Express. By the end, you'll understand how to create endpoints that can handle different types of requests and return JSON data.\n\n## Learning Path\n\n1. **Understanding APIs and HTTP** - Learn what APIs are and how HTTP requests work\n2. **REST Architecture Principles** - Master the four main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n3. **Building Your First API** - Create a simple Express.js server with CRUD operations\n\nThis hands-on approach will give you the confidence to start building backend services and understand how modern web applications work under the hood.",

You (the client) tell the waiter (API) what you want from the menu (available endpoints), and the waiter brings your order from the kitchen (server/database).\n\n### Real-World Example\nWhen you check the weather on your phone:\n1. Your app sends a request to a weather API\n2. The API fetches data from weather databases\n3. The API returns the weather data to your app\n4. Your app displays the weather information\n\n## HTTP Basics\n\n**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the language that web browsers and servers use to communicate.\n\n### HTTP Request Structure\n```\nGET /api/users HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/json\n```\n\n### HTTP Response Structure\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"users\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Ahmed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Common HTTP Status Codes\n\n- **200 OK** - Request successful\n- **201 Created** - Resource created successfully\n- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid request\n- **404 Not Found** - Resource not found\n- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server error\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- APIs enable different applications to communicate\n- HTTP is the protocol used for web communication\n- Every HTTP request has a method, URL, headers, and optional body\n- HTTP responses include status codes and data"
